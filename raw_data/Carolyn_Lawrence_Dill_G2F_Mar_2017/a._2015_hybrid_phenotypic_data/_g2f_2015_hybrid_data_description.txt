G2F 2015 Hybrid Data

The experimental design for the 2015 data set was an incomplete block design
with 20 blocks at most locations.  Each location was divided into two replicate 
blocks with each replicated hybrid planted once in each replicate block.  Each 
replicate block was divided into 10 incomplete blocks for placement of check 
hybrids among the incomplete blocks.  Most locations had 500 hybrids. Data types
collected are described in Table 1.

Investigators indicated certain plots had been replaced with filler (any
variety of corn used as a placeholder for missing plots) and/or certain plots
should be discarded.  Columns indicated as filler may have data in
the data set, but those data are considered unusable by the investigator.  In
addition, some values were identified as being out of range of observable
values and those observations were changed to missing values in the final
curated
data set with conditions listed in Table 2.  Comments provided by investigators
are provided in Table 3.

ILH2            High N vs. Low      The “Harvest Moisture” values refer to

                                    these plots by hand, and so rather than
                                    obtaining these values from a plot combine,
                                    instead measured a sample of the grain
                                    taken from the plots on a hand-held Dickey-

                                    the moisture meter did indicate a value for
                                    test weight, my student Jessica forgot to
                                    record that value the day of harvest. So
                                    she measured grain samples from each plot
                                    again after they had been dried, using the
                                    same moisture meter, but primarily to get
                                    the test weight number.  However, for
                                    reference, she included the moisture at the
                                    time of measure as “Grain Moisture”.

                                    we had since the end of April, there are
                                    four water logged sections in both trials
                                    that will affect uniformity of performance
                                    and I wonder if I should continue with the
                                    trial. Germination was good and uniform but
                                    you can see an effect in growth in 4 clear
                                    and distinctive patches and this will cause
                                    a lot of difference in performance to those
                                    entries. 6/17/15 We have had uninterrupted
                                    rains every week since early April with
                                    only one or two days per week to plant so
                                    we were able to plant it Tuesday of last

                                    combination of strong rain and tile
                                    drainage during early season caused severe
                                    variation in plant development sometimes
                                    between rows within plot or within rows in
                                    some areas of the field. FT data was taken
                                    following the 50% rule (i.e. if one row
                                    flowered and the other one not, plot was
                                    considered flowered). Notes about this
                                    variation were taken and added in the plots
