G2F 2015 Weather Data

Twenty-four hybrid and twenty-eight inbred experiments were conducted in fields
across seventeen states and the province of Ontario, Canada. Some fields were 
relatively close to one another allowing collaborators to use a single weather
station for multiple fields (Table 10). Weather data was collected at 30-minute 
intervals with a Spectrum WatchDog 2700 weather station throughout the growing 
season. Each station measured wind speed, direction, and gust; air temperature,
dewpoint,and relative humidity; soil temperature and moisture; rainfall and 
solar radiation. Some stations had additional measurements including soil 
electrical conductivity, ultra-voilet (UV) light, carbon dioxide (CO2), and 
photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).

The weather stations were equipped with several ports to attach external
sensors. The data from the sensors were then collected in columns with headers
that corresponded to the ports used. Collaborators were also able to choose
between imperial and metric units upon station setup. This was also indicated
in the column name creating several possible column names for the same
measurement. Collaborators were able to set the time upon weather station
setup, but the time zone is not indicated in the weather data files requiring
investigators to ensure the time was set properly.

Setup instructions did not include steps to ensure proper siting for the
weather station. Therefore, especially in the case of wind speed, observations
should be considered microscale and are only representative of the field.
Investigators compared observations to the nearest National Weather Service
(NWS) Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) airport weather station to
verify the data time zone as well as identify erroneous data points. In order
to create the cleaned data set (Table 11), investigators converted the data to
local time (if necessary), provided the observation time in Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC) to allow easy comparison between stations, and converted
all data to metric units for consistency. Erroneous data was replaced by a
blank using the methods outlined in Table 12 which were, in part, borrowed from
the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) “Guidelines on Quality Control
Procedures for Data from Automatic Weather Stations”.

Upon station setup, not all stations set the wind vane to North. Therefore, in
several cases the wind direction required calibration. Investigators strongly
suggest that users planning to utilize the wind direction data download the
calibrated data set. In order to ensure the experiment provides quality weather
data, stations with observations that exhibited a systematic bias, like the
wind direction, were calibrated. The methods of calibration are outlined in
Table 13. Note that not all elements are able to be calibrated. In cases where
the weather element was not calibrated, but a calibration column exists, the
observation column was simply copied. The column headers for the calibrated
data set are located in Table 14. Observations separated by station location
and weather element with asterisks indicating calibration are outlined in Table
15.

Variable               | Cleaning Method
-----------------------|-------------------------------------------
Temperature,           | Observations that differed from the NWS ASOS by an
Dewpoint,and           | amount more than could be explained by the accuracy of
Relative Humidity      | the instrument were investigated further. In cases
                       | where a large difference could not be explained (i.e.
                       | a temperature spike at night due to microscale
                       | temperature inversion), it was eliminated. The dew
                       | point cannot exceed the temperature so in cases where
                       | this occurred both were eliminated. Values exceeding
                       | the range of accepted values as set out by the WMO
                       | were eliminated. Finally, cases of unusual variability
                       | were also eliminated.
                       |
Soil Temperature       | Observations greater than the air temperature were
                       | flagged and investigated further. Cases of unusual
                       | variability were eliminated.
                       |
Soil Moisture          | Observations were compared with rainfall observations
                       | to determine accuracy of drastic changes. Times where
                       | a large increase in soil moisture could not be
                       | explained by rainfall or irrigation were eliminated.
                       |
Solar Radiation        | Observations greater than 1400 W/m2 were considered
                       | erroneous as the solar constant is 1362 W/m2.
                       | Observations near zero during the day and greater than
                       | zero at night were also eliminated. Using the WMO
                       | guidelines, cases of unusual variability between time
                       | steps were also eliminated.
                       |
Rainfall               | Monthly rainfall totals were determined for the
                       | experiment stations as well as NWS ASOS stations for
                       | comparison. The maximum 30-minute total rainfall was
                       | also checked to eliminate values where rainfall was
                       | unnaturally heavy. Cases where the tipping bucket
                       | consistently reported a single tip (0.254 mm) were
                       | also investigated as this can indicate a plugged
                       | bucket.
                       |
Wind Speed,            | Wind is highly spatially variable. Therefore, rather
Wind Direction, and    | than do a check against the sensors’ accuracy,
Wind Gust              | periods of strong winds at the experiment stations
                       | were compared to the nearby NWS ASOS stations in an
                       | attempt to document systematic bias for later
                       | calibration. Times where the experiment station
                       | differed greatly from the NWS ASOS station were
                       | investigated. Observations with significant
                       | discrepancy were eliminated. In cases where
                       | a wind direction was reported with a zero wind speed,
                       | the wind direction was eliminated. Finally, using the
                       | WMO guidelines, cases of unusual variability between
                       | time steps were also eliminated.
                       |
UV Light and PAR       | Observations near zero during the day and observations
                       | much greater than zero at night were eliminated.
                       |
CO2                    | Observations greater than 400 ppm were flagged and
                       | eliminated if necessary.

Variable               | Calibration Method
-----------------------|-------------------------------------------
Temperature,           | Temperature, dewpoint, and relative humidity
Dewpoint and           | observations were compared to the nearby NWS ASOS
Relative Humidity      | station. In cases of a systematic bias, the average
                       | bias  was computed and then subtracted from each
                       | observation  value.
                       |
Soil Temperature and   | There are no soil temperature or moisture
Soil Moisture          | observations at the NWS ASOS stations so these values
                       | were only cleaned, not calibrated.
                       |
Solar Radiation        | There are no solar radiation observations at the NWS
                       | ASOS stations so these values were only cleaned, not
                       | calibrated.
                       |
Rainfall               | Rainfall is greatly spatially variable. Therefore,
                       | the observations were cleaned to remove obviously
                       | erroneous values, but were not calibrated.
                       |
Wind Speed             | Wind is highly spatially variable and is especially
                       | difficult to verify at low speeds. Therefore, only
                       | periods of high wind speed were used for comparison to
                       | the NWS ASOS stations. If speeds were not well-
                       | correlated a single correction value was subtracted
                       | from all observations.
                       |
Wind Gust and          | Again, only periods of high wind speed were used for
Wind Direction         | comparison to the NWS ASOS stations. If directions
                       | were not well-correlated a single correction value was
                       | subtracted from all observations.
                       |
UV Light and PAR       | There are no UV light or PAR observations at the NWS
                       | ASOS stations so these values were only cleaned, not
                       | calibrated.
                       |
CO2                    | There are no CO2 observations at the NWS ASOS stations
                       | so these values were only cleaned, not calibrated.
