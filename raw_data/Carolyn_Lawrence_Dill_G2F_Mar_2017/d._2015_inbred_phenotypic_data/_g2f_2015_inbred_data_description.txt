G2F 2015 Inbred Data

Thirty one inbreds (Table 7), were planted at 18 locations and across 13
states, with two experiment locations planted very close to one another in
Columbia, Missouri and College Station, Texas.  Experiments, within locations
were planted in a randomized complete block design (RCBD).  Two to twelve
complete replicates of each inbred were planted at each location; each inbred
grown was randomized within each replicate.  Each inbred, in the data set, was
assigned a unique inbred code (located in ‘code’ column of the dataset).

Investigators indicated certain plots had been replaced with filler (any
variety of corn used as a placeholder for missing plots) or identified outside
of predetermined ranges and therefore discarded (Table 8).  Columns indicated
as Filler or discarded may have data in the data set, but those data considered
unusable by the investigator.  Comments provided by investigators are provided
in Table 9.
