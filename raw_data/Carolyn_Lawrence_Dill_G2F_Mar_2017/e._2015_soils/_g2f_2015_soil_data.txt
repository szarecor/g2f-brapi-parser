Column Name            | Column Description
-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------
LabID                  | The name of the soil test lab who calculated the
                       | results
                       |
LabSmplId              | Internal ID number assigned sample by the testing
                       | center.
                       |
SmplDate               | The date the sample was analyzed by the lab.
                       |
                       | 
CoopName               | The cooperator's name associated to the field 
                       | experiment.
                       | 
Experiment             | G2F experiment identification.
                       | 
PlowDepth              | A variable used by the lab to calculate soil lime 
                       | needs that covers most field tillage operations.
                       |
PH                     | Soil PH determined by this procedure:
                       | Pepare a 1:1 soil to water mixture and measure the pH
                       | with a glass electrode.
                       |
Buffer pH (BpH)        | Sikora buffer pH calculated by this procedure:
                       | Prepare a 1:1:1 soil to water to Sikora buffer mixture
                       | and measure the pH with a glass electrode.
                       |
Organic matter (OM)    | Soil organic matter expressed in percent, and 
                       | calculated by this procedure:
                       | Loss of weight on ignition at 360°C for 2 hours. 
                       | OM = 0.07 + 0.89(LOI)
                       |                 (LOI = percent weight loss on ignition)
Phosphorus (P)         | Phosphorus levels reported in parts per million (ppm)
                       | and calculated by this procedure:
                       | Extract with Bray 1, develop color, and measure
                       | colorimetrically using a spectrophotometer. 
                       |
Potassium (K)          | Potassium levels reported in parts per million (ppm)
                       | and calculated by this procedure:
                       | Extract with Bray 1 and measure with atomic absorption,
                       | flame photometer, or ICP-OES.
                       |
