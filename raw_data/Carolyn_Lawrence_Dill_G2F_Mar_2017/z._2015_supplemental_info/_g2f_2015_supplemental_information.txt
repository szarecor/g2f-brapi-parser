G2F 2015 Supplemental Information

Investigators compiled cooperator information by field, any field-level data
(referred to as metadata), and irrigation dates into the following files:

The contents of each file are detailed below:

▶ g2f_2015_cooperator_list.csv
    Contains the cooperator name, location, and weather station id for each
    experiment.

    IF an experiment was irrigated/fertigated, the date of application and 
    amounts are recorded in these columns:

** please note that two experiments TXH1 and TXI1 are listed as irrigated, with
   no irrigation quantities reported due to the adequate rainfall received 
   through the growing season.
